# Computer-Vision
Code and writeup of my independent computer vision project, in which I implemented the Fast R-CNN model in PyTorch and trained the model to detect objects using the COCO API and dataset.<br>
pycoco.ipynb explains the COCO API and how the R-CNN model works.<br>
run_rcnn.ipynb contains the code to train the model and evaluate the accuracy of the trained model.<br>
Computer_Vision_Writeup.pdf gives an in-depth explanation of the history of CNN's and their architectures, as well as the results gotten from training the R-CNN model on the COCO dataset.
