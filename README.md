# Computer-Vision
Code and writeup of my independent computer vision project I did for my machine vision class final, in which Fast R-CNN model implemented in PyTorch is used to detect objects using the COCO API and dataset.
<br><br>
**pycoco.ipynb** explains the COCO API and how the R-CNN model works.<br>
**run_rcnn.ipynb** contains the code for the model and evaluation of the accuracy of the trained model.<br>
**Computer_Vision_Writeup.pdf** gives an in-depth explanation of the history of CNN's and their architectures, as well as the results gotten from training the R-CNN model on the COCO dataset.
